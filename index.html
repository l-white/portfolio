    <h3><button>=></button> Meme Generator</h3>
    <div class="hidden"><p><img alt="cat meme" class="portfolio-img float-left" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/83/DoctorWho42_cat_Snow.jpg?20150107013737" />Okay, I admit it: I love memes! Some of my favorite projects for the web involve generating memes or using the GIPHY API to get memes to appear on a webpage.</p>
    <p>This simple web app allows you to generate your own memes through a simple form and the only time I will ever use the Comic Sans font in a web app.</p>
    <p>Check out my <a href="https://github.com/l-white/create-memes" target="_blank">Github repo</a> to see the code or a <a href="https://l-white.github.io/create-memes/" target="_blank">working version of this application</a> to try it out.</p>

    <h3><button>=></button> Memory Game</h3>
    <div class="hidden"><p>It seems that a right of passage for a front-end developer is building a memory game from scratch. While there are many different ways to approach a project like this, I opted for vanilla JavaScript and kept the web design very simple to concentrate on the logic.</p>

    <h3><button>=></button> Lavender Hill Properties Website</h3>
    <div class="hidden"><p>The <a href="http://l-white.github.io/Lavender-Hill-Properties/" target="_blank"></a>Lavender Hill Properties</a> website was designed for now husband in 2015 when I first learned how to put HTML and CSS together. Currently, I am redesigning the website using React, CSS in JS components and adding a node.js backend so that emails can be sent directly for inquiries. It's always a great feeling to put new skills to use.</p>

    <p>The website was created to better support the educational needs of the 75,000 K-8 public school children in Milwaukee and their families during the Covid-19 pandemic when virtual learning was necessary.</p>

    <h3><button>=></button> Diederich College of Communication Website</h3>
    <div class="hidden"><p><img alt="two marquette students walking on campus" class="portfolio-img float-left" src="https://www.marquette.edu/communication/images/raynor_fall_1_700.jpg"/>Migrating the Diederich College of Communication website for Marquette University is one of the largest web development projects I have undertaken to date. The website was originally 500 pages. The migration process included re-writing and re-structuring the website so that it was down to 350 webpages and every webpage could be accessed within one level of the website. I also re-wrote the meta descriptions to improve SEO. I was part of a 10-person team at Marquette, selected to participate in this process while keeping up with my other job responsibilities as multimedia manager.</p>
      <p>With the exception of some changes to the navigation bar and homepage, most of the web designs I implemented are still intact.</p>

    <h3><button>=></button> Technical SEO / Reporting</h3>
    <div class="hidden"><p>In both the Google Analytics and Marketing Analytics nanodegrees that I earned from Udemy, I did in-depth work in Google Analytics to learn how to create custom reports, dashboards, and set alerts. I also learned best practices for communicating findings through reports.</p>
    <p>In addition to data exploration, this project also required advanced techniques in Google Analytics, including filtering and segmentation. The data was from the Google Merchandise Store to mimic an eCommerce scenario. In my role as the webmaster for Milwaukee Public Schools, I have curated several reports for departments that were seeking specific information on their web traffic and the effects on their marketing campaigns.</p>
