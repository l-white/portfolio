    <h3><button>=></button> Meme Generator</h3>
    <div class="hidden"><img id="cat-meme" alt="cat meme" class="float-left" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/83/DoctorWho42_cat_Snow.jpg?20150107013737" /><p>Okay, I admit it: I love memes! Some of my favorite projects for the web involve generating memes or using the GIPHY API to get memes to appear on a webpage.</p>
    <p>This simple web app allows you to generate your own memes through a simple form and the only time I will ever use the Comic Sans font in a web app.</p>

    <h3><button>=></button> Connect Four Game</h3>
    <div class="hidden"><p>One of my bigger accomplishments during my bootcamp at Springboard was building a Connect 4 game with JavaScript. The game uses an array to keep track of which pieces belong to player 1 or player 2. The code to check for the winner was implemented by the Springboard instructors.</p>

Currently, I am redesigning the website using React, CSS in JS components and adding a node.js backend so that emails can be sent directly for inquiries.

    <h3><button>=></button> Technical SEO / Reporting</h3>
    <div class="hidden"><p>In both the Google Analytics and Marketing Analytics nanodegrees that I earned from Udemy, I did in-depth work in Google Analytics to learn how to create custom reports, dashboards, and set alerts. I also learned best practices for communicating findings through reports.</p>
    <p>In addition to data exploration, this project also required advanced techniques in Google Analytics, including filtering and segmentation. The data was from the Google Merchandise Store to mimic an eCommerce scenario. In my role as the webmaster for Milwaukee Public Schools, I have curated several reports for departments that were seeking specific information on their web traffic and the effects on their marketing campaigns.</p>
